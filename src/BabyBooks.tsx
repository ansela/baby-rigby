          Instead of cards, Paige has requested baby books to add to Baby Boy
          Rigby's collection. There are books to choose from on the registry or
          maybe you have a childhood favorite? We are asking that you write a
          personal note to Baby Rigby inside the book as well. Your note to Baby
          will be cherished for years to come!
